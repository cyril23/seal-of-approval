# Version 9.5 - Critical Bug Fix

## Problem
Game crashed immediately on startup with:
```
Uncaught ReferenceError: i is not defined at LevelGenerator.js:93
```

## Root Cause
In Version 9.4, when converting from a `for` loop to a `while` loop for platform generation, the loop variable `i` was removed but line 93 still referenced it.

## Fix
Changed line 93 in LevelGenerator.js from:
```javascript
if (Math.random() < 0.15 && i > 2) {
```
To:
```javascript
if (Math.random() < 0.15 && actualPlatformsGenerated > 2) {
```

## Status
âœ… **FIXED** - Game now starts and runs correctly

## Testing Required
1. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Run `npm run dev`
3. Verify console shows: "Seal.js Version: 9.5"
4. Test all Version 9.4 fixes still work:
   - Arctic theme: Can collect fish
   - After growing: Seal sits flush on platform
   - Level progress: Platforms generate to 100%

## Files Modified
- `/src/managers/LevelGenerator.js` - Fixed undefined variable
- `/src/entities/Seal.js` - Updated version log to 9.5
