# Arctic Theme Fish Collision Bug Documentation

## Problem Description
In the Arctic theme specifically, the seal cannot collect fish. The fish appear visually but collision detection fails to trigger.

## Symptoms
- Fish sprites are visible in Arctic theme
- Seal passes through fish without collecting them
- No collision events are triggered
- Other themes work correctly

## Root Cause Analysis

### Identified Issue (Version 9.4)
The Arctic-specific body position manual update in the bobbing animation was corrupting the physics body collision detection.

**The Problem Code (lines 39-43 in Collectible.js):**
```javascript
if (this.scene.currentTheme && this.scene.currentTheme.name === 'arctic') {
    // Manual position update was interfering with collision
    this.body.position.x = this.x - this.body.halfWidth;
    this.body.position.y = this.y - this.body.halfHeight;
}
```

This manual positioning was overriding Phaser's internal collision detection system, causing the physics engine to miss overlaps.

## Version 9.4 Fix Implementation ✅

### Solution
Removed the Arctic-specific body update and unified the physics body update across all themes.

**Fixed Code:**
```javascript
onUpdate: () => {
    if (this.body && this.body.enable) {
        // Version 9.4: Always use updateFromGameObject for consistent physics
        this.body.updateFromGameObject();
    }
}
```

### Why This Works
- `updateFromGameObject()` properly syncs the physics body with the sprite position
- Maintains collision detection integrity
- Works consistently across all themes
- Preserves the bobbing animation without breaking physics

### Additional Improvements
1. **Enhanced Collision Logging** (GameScene.js):
   - Logs all fish collisions, not just Arctic
   - Shows body enabled state and visibility
   - Helps diagnose any remaining issues

2. **Z-ordering** (retained from v9.3):
   - Collectibles at depth 10
   - Player at depth 5
   - Ensures proper rendering order

## Testing Verification
1. Start game and wait for Arctic theme (white/blue background)
2. Move seal towards fish
3. Expected console output:
   ```
   Arctic: Created fish at (x, y), texture: fish
   arctic theme: Collision detected with fish at (x, y)
   Collectible body enabled: true, visible: true
   Fish eaten! Score: +200, New seal size: 2
   ```
4. Fish should disappear and score should increase

## Status
✅ **FIXED in Version 9.4** - Arctic-specific body update removed, collision detection restored.

## Technical Notes
- The bobbing animation continues to work via `updateFromGameObject()`
- No special handling needed for Arctic theme
- Physics bodies remain properly synchronized with visual positions
- Collision detection works consistently across all themes
