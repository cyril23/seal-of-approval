# Arctic Theme Fish Collision Bug Documentation

## Problem Description
In the Arctic theme specifically, the seal cannot collect fish. The fish appear visually but collision detection fails to trigger.

## Symptoms
- Fish sprites are visible in Arctic theme
- Seal passes through fish without collecting them
- No collision events are triggered
- Other themes work correctly

## Root Cause Analysis

### Identified Issue (Version 9.4)
The Arctic-specific body position manual update in the bobbing animation was corrupting the physics body collision detection.

**The Problem Code (lines 39-43 in Collectible.js):**
```javascript
if (this.scene.currentTheme && this.scene.currentTheme.name === 'arctic') {
    // Manual position update was interfering with collision
    this.body.position.x = this.x - this.body.halfWidth;
    this.body.position.y = this.y - this.body.halfHeight;
}
```

This manual positioning was overriding Phaser's internal collision detection system, causing the physics engine to miss overlaps.

## Version 9.4 Fix Implementation ‚úÖ

### Solution
Removed the Arctic-specific body update and unified the physics body update across all themes.

**Fixed Code:**
```javascript
onUpdate: () => {
    if (this.body && this.body.enable) {
        // Version 9.4: Always use updateFromGameObject for consistent physics
        this.body.updateFromGameObject();
    }
}
```

### Why This Works
- `updateFromGameObject()` properly syncs the physics body with the sprite position
- Maintains collision detection integrity
- Works consistently across all themes
- Preserves the bobbing animation without breaking physics

### Additional Improvements
1. **Enhanced Collision Logging** (GameScene.js):
   - Logs all fish collisions, not just Arctic
   - Shows body enabled state and visibility
   - Helps diagnose any remaining issues

2. **Z-ordering** (retained from v9.3):
   - Collectibles at depth 10
   - Player at depth 5
   - Ensures proper rendering order

## Testing Verification
1. Start game and wait for Arctic theme (white/blue background)
2. Move seal towards fish
3. Expected console output:
   ```
   Arctic: Created fish at (x, y), texture: fish
   arctic theme: Collision detected with fish at (x, y)
   Collectible body enabled: true, visible: true
   Fish eaten! Score: +200, New seal size: 2
   ```
4. Fish should disappear and score should increase

## Status
‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIALLY FIXED in Version 1.2** - Texture issue identified but polar_bear still breaks Arctic!

## Root Cause Discovered üéØ
The `polar_bear` enemy had a texture loading issue that broke ALL collision detection in Arctic theme!

### The Bug
```javascript
// Enemy.js line 6 (BROKEN):
const textureKey = type.toLowerCase().replace('_', ''); 
// This converted 'polar_bear' to 'polarbear' (removed underscore)

// But PreloadScene created texture as 'polar_bear' (with underscore)
this.textures.addCanvas(key.toLowerCase(), canvas); // 'POLAR_BEAR' -> 'polar_bear'
```

**Result**: Enemy tried to load non-existent texture 'polarbear', causing physics system failure!

## Version 1.2 Partial Fix ‚ö†Ô∏è

### What We Fixed
Corrected the texture key mismatch in Enemy.js:
```javascript
// Fixed line 6:
const textureKey = type.toLowerCase(); // Now keeps 'polar_bear' intact
```

### What's Still Broken
**POLAR_BEAR STILL BREAKS ARCTIC COLLISION!** Even with correct texture loading:
- When polar_bear is present, ALL collisions fail in Arctic
- Commenting out polar_bear from enemies array fixes it
- Replacing polar_bear with any other enemy fixes it
- Issue is specific to polar_bear enemy, not just texture loading

### Current Workaround
In constants.js, Arctic theme has polar_bear commented out:
```javascript
enemies: ['human'] // polar_bear removed until fixed
```

### Next Investigation Needed
1. Check if polar_bear's charge behavior corrupts physics
2. Investigate if detection range calculation breaks collision system
3. Test if polar_bear's tint/color changes affect collision detection

## Technical Notes
- The bobbing animation works via `updateFromGameObject()`
- No Arctic-specific code in Collectible.js (unified across themes)
- Physics bodies should be synchronized with visual positions
- Other themes work correctly, suggesting Arctic-specific issue
